# Introduction
Web interfaces are often great ways to comunicate with data, being ubiquous, visual and interactive means. This projects is my first web data visualization and aims to offer insights related to the weather of a location depending on its latitude and longitude. To show these visualizations (made with Python) a simple website was created using HTML and Bootstrap. The final project is deployed online using GitHub pages [in this link](https://javisandoval94.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html).

# Data set
The data set for this project comes from the analysis performed in the first part of my [python-api-challenge repository](https://github.com/JaviSandoval94/python-api-challenge). Results from than repository were exported as a `.csv`file and saved in the `cities.csv` file in the `Resources` folder of this repository.

# Code explanation
The visualizations for this project were elaborated using Matplotlib and saved as `.png` images in the `visualizations` folder of this repository. In addition, a table was prepared in HTML format using the provided data. The code to prepare this table can be found in the `Data-Table-HTML-Export.ipynb` file in the `Resources` folder and the final table is saved as `HTML-cities-table.html` in the `WebVisualizations` folder.
